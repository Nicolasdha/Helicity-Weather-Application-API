### Technologies
This application was created using the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap4
* Dark Sky API
* Skycons
* Heroku - To host CORS proxy
* Github Pages


### Launch

 This application is initalized using npm's gh-pages to be hosted on Github Pages. Please follow this hyperlink to be taken to where this application is hosted:

Please feel free to use this application on all mobile devices as well, it is completly optimized for all devices and desktop sizes.

I created a CORS proxy hosted on Heroku to be able to send myriad requests to Dark Sky API without a problem. Subsequently, the first API call might take marginally longer to connect.

### Structure

This application's simplistic structure makes it easy to digest, and extremely pleasing to look at.

It was created using the Apple aquired Dark Sky API, so it is as accurate (or possibly even more so)
than the weather apps you are currently using. Since this API is so powerful, I decided to keep the design of it simplistic, as to be able to digest what you need about the weather in the days to come very quickly.
It gives you exactly what you want to know, no more - no less.

It automatically provides you with information relavent to your geographical location, no matter where you are using it. People in Germany will get the same percise information they want, as compared to people stateside.

The application breaks down the current day's weather into bite size pieces, and then goes into a weekly forcast below that.

Thank you for visiting! <br><br><br>
